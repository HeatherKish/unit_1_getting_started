### Homework Work Flow

1.  Follow the link to your homework assigment
    +  the links are on the README file for each unit repository
    +  link your GitHub account to your username listed in the roster (1st assignment only)
2.  `Accept` the assignment
3.  Follow the link to your new, private homework repository
4.  Clone the repository to your local computer 
    +  Click `Code` and copy the repo link
    +  Open RStudio and create a new project with Git version control using the repo link
5.  Do the homework assignment
    +  Add your text and code to answer the questions at the bottom of the HW file (e.g. `HW_2a_sea_level_rise.Rmd`)
6.  Use the `Git` pane in RStudio to push out your new files and edits to the online repo by the due date
    + You can push out edits as often as you want - I won't look at or consider your homework "final" until after the due date.
